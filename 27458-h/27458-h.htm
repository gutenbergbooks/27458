<hr class="two" style="width: 65%;" />
<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>&AElig;schylus, the first of the great Grecian writers of
tragedy, was born at Eleusis, in 525 B.C. He was the son of
Euphorion, who was probably a wealthy owner of rich vineyards. The
poet's early employment was to watch the grapes and protect them
from the ravages of men and other animals, and it is said that this
occupation led to the development of his dramatic genius. It is
more easy to believe that it was responsible for the development of
certain other less admirable qualities of the poet.</p>

<p>His first appearance as a tragic writer was in 499 B.C., and in
484 B.C. he won a prize in the tragic contests. He took part in the
battle of Marathon, in 490 B.C., and also fought in the battle of
Salamis, in 480 B.C. He visited Sicily twice, and probably spent
some time in that country, as the use of many Sicilian words in his
later plays would indicate.</p>

<p>There is a curious story related as to his death, which took
place at Gela in 456 B.C. It is said that an eagle, mistaking his
bald head for a stone, dropped a tortoise upon it in order to break
its shell, and that the blow quite killed &AElig;schylus. Too much
reliance should not be placed upon this story.</p>

<p>It is not known how many plays the poet wrote, but <span class=
'pagenum'>vi</span>only seven have been preserved to us. That these
tragedies contain much that is undramatic is undoubtedly true, but
it must be remembered that at the time he wrote, &AElig;schylus
found the drama in a very primitive state. The persons represented
consisted of but a single actor, who related some narrative of
mythological or legendary interest, and a chorus, who relieved the
monotony of such a performance by the interspersing of a few songs
and dances. To &AElig;schylus belongs the credit of creating the
dialogue in the Greek drama by the introduction of a second
actor.</p>

<p>In the following pages will be found a translation of two of the
poet's greatest compositions, viz., the "Prometheus Chained" and
the "Seven Against Thebes." The first of these dramas has been
designated "The sublimest poem and simplest tragedy of antiquity,"
and the second, while probably an earlier work and containing much
that is undramatic, presents such a splendid spectacle of true
Grecian chivalry that it has been regarded as the equal of anything
which the author ever attempted.</p>

<p>The characters represented in the "Prometheus" are Strength,
Force, Vulcan, Prometheus, Io, daughter of Inachus, Ocean and
Mercury. The play opens with the appearance of Prometheus in
company with Strength, Force and Vulcan, who have been bidden to
bind Prometheus with adamantine fetters to the lofty cragged rocks
of an untrodden Scythian desert, because he has offended Jupiter by
stealing fire from heaven and bestowing it upon mortals.</p>

<p>Vulcan is loth to obey the mandates of Jove, but urged on by
Strength and Force and the fear of the consequences <span class=
'pagenum'>vii</span> which disobedience will entail, with mighty
force drives the wedges into the adamantine rocks and rivets the
captive with galling shackles to the ruthless crags.</p>

<p>Prometheus, being bound and left alone, bemoans his fate and
relates to the chorus of nymphs the base ingratitude of Jove, who
through his counsels having overwhelmed the aged Saturn beneath the
murky abyss of Tartarus, now rewards his ally with indignities
because he had compassion upon mortals.</p>

<p>Ocean then comes to Prometheus, offering sympathy and counsel,
urging him not to utter words thus harsh and whetted, lest Jupiter
seated far aloft may hear them and inflict upon him added woes to
which his present sufferings will seem but child's play.</p>

<p>Ocean having taken his departure, Prometheus again complains to
the chorus and enumerates the boons which he has bestowed upon
mankind, with the comment that though he has discovered such
inventions for mortals, he has no device whereby he may escape from
his present misfortune.</p>

<p>Io, daughter of Inachus, beloved by Jove, but forced, through
the jealous hatred of Juno, to make many wanderings, then appears,
and beseeches Prometheus to discover to her what time shall be the
limit of her sufferings. Prometheus accedes to her request and
relates how she shall wander over many lands and seas until she
reaches the city of Canopus, at the mouth of the Nile, where she
shall bring forth a Jove-begotten child, from whose seed shall
finally spring a dauntless warrior renowned in archery, who will
liberate Prometheus from his captivity and accomplish the downfall
of Jove.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>viii</span>Io then resumes her wanderings,
and Mercury, sent by Jove, comes to question Prometheus as to the
nuptials which he has boasted will accomplish the overthrow of the
ruler of the Gods. Him Prometheus reviles with opprobrious
epithets, calling him a lackey of the Gods, and refuses to disclose
anything concerning the matter on which he questions him. The
winged God, replying, threatens him with dire calamities. A tempest
will come upon him and overwhelm him with thunderbolts, and a
bloodthirsting eagle shall feed upon his liver. Thus saying, he
departs, and immediately the earth commences to heave, the noise of
thunder is heard, vivid streaks of lightning blaze throughout the
sky and a hurricane&mdash;the onslaught of Jove&mdash;sweeps
Prometheus away in its blast.</p>

<p>The "Seven against Thebes" includes in its cast of characters
Eteocles, King of Thebes, Antigone and Ismene, Sisters of the King,
a Messenger and a Herald. The play opens with the siege of Thebes.
Eteocles appears upon the Acropolis in the early morning, and
exhorts the citizens to be brave and be not over-dismayed at the
rabble of alien besiegers. A messenger arrives and announces the
rapid approach of the Argives. Eteocles goes to see that the
battlements and the gates are properly manned, and during his
absence the chorus of Theban maidens set up a great wail of
distress and burst forth with violent lamentations. Eteocles,
returning, upbraids them severely for their weakness and bids them
begone and raise the sacred auspicious shout of the p&aelig;an as
an encouragement to the Theban warriors. He then departs to prepare
himself and six others to meet in combat the seven chieftains who
have come against the city.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>ix</span>He soon re-enters, and at the
same time comes the messenger from another part of the city with
fresh tidings of the foe and the arrangement of the invaders around
the walls of the city. By the gate of Pr&oelig;tus stands the
raging Tydeus with his helm of hairy crests and his buckler tricked
out with a full moon and a gleaming sky full of stars, against whom
Eteocles will marshal the wary son of Astacus, a noble and a modest
youth, who detests vain boastings and yet is not a coward.</p>

<p>By the Electron gate is stationed the giant Campaneus, who bears
about him the device of a naked man with a gleaming torch in his
hands, crying out "I will burn the city." Against him will be
pitted the doughty Polyphontes, favored by Diana and other
gods.</p>

<p>Against the gate of Neis the mighty Eteoclus is wheeling his
foaming steeds, bearing a buckler blazoned with a man in armor
treading the steps of a ladder to his foeman's tower. Megareus, the
offspring of Creon, is the valiant warrior who will either pay the
debt of his nurture to his land or will decorate his father's house
with the spoils of the conquered Eteoclus.</p>

<p>The fiery Hippomedon is raging at the gate of Onca Minerva,
bearing upon his buckler a Typhon darting forth smoke through his
fire-breathing mouth, eager to meet the brave Hyperbius, son of
&OElig;nops, who has been selected to check his impetuous
onslaught.</p>

<p>At the gate of Boreas the youthful Parthenop&aelig;us takes his
stand, a fair-faced stripling, upon whose face the youthful down is
just making its appearance. Opposed to him stands Actor, a man who
is no braggart, but who will not submit to boastful tauntings or
permit the rash intruder to batter his way into the city.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'>x</span>The mighty Amphiarus is waiting at
the gate of Homol&ouml;is, and in the meantime reproaches his ally,
Tydeus, calling him a homicide, and Polynices he rebukes with
having brought a mighty armament into his native city. Lasthenes,
he of the aged mind but youthful form, is the Thebian who has been
chosen to marshal his forces against this invader.</p>

<p>At the seventh gate stands Polynices, brother of Eteocles,
bearing a well-wrought shield with a device constructed upon it of
a woman leading on a mailed warrior, bringing havoc to his paternal
city and desirous of becoming a fratricide. Against him Eteocles
will go and face him in person, and leader against leader, brother
against brother and foeman against foeman, take his stand.</p>

<p>Eteocles then departs to engage in battle, and soon after the
messenger enters to announce that six of the Theban warriors have
been successful, but that Polynices and Eteocles have both fallen,
slain by each other's hand.</p>

<p>Antigone and Ismene then enter, each bewailing the death of
their brothers. A herald interrupts them in the midst of their
lamentations to announce to them the decree of the senate, which is
that Eteocles, on account of his attachment to his country, though
a fratricide, shall be honored with fitting funeral rites, but that
Polynices, the would-be overturner of his native city, shall be
cast out unburied, a prey to the dogs.</p>

<p>Against this decree Antigone rebels, and with her final words
announces her unalterable intention of burying her brother in spite
of the fate which awaits her disobedience to the will of the
senate.</p>

<h2>PROMETHEUS CHAINED.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="two">Prometheus having, by his attention to the wants of
men, provoked the anger of Jove, is bound down in a cleft of a rock
in a distant desert of Scythia. Here he not only relates the
wanderings, but foretells the future lot of Io, and likewise
alludes to the fall of Jove's dynasty. Disdaining to explain his
meaning to Mercury, he is swept into the abyss amid terrific
hurricane and earthquake.</p>

me to take courage for this task; for a dreadful thing it is to
disregard<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href=

hoar-frost of the morn; and evermore shall the pain of the present
evil waste thee; for no one yet born shall release thee. Such
fruits hast thou reaped from thy friendly disposition to mankind.
For thou, a god, not crouching beneath the wrath of the gods, hast
imparted to mortals honors beyond what was right. In requital
whereof thou shalt keep sentinel on this cheerless rock, standing
erect, sleepless, not bending a knee:<a name="FNanchor_10" id=

and many laments and unavailing groans shalt thou utter; for the
heart of Jupiter is hard to be entreated; and every one that has
newly-acquired power is stern.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St.</span> Well, well! Why art thou delaying
and vainly commiserating? Why loathest thou not the god that is

mortals?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vul.</span> Relationship and intimacy are of
great power.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St.</span> I grant it&mdash;but how is it
possible to disobey the Sire's word? Dreadest thou not this the

<p><span class="smcap">Vul.</span> Ay truly thou art ever pitiless
and full of boldness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St.</span> For to deplore this wretch is no
cure [for him]. But concern not thou thyself vainly with matters
that are of no advantage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vul.</span> O much detested handicraft!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St.</span> Wherefore loathest thou it! for
with the ills now present thy craft in good truth is not at all
chargeable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Vul.</span> For all that, I would that some

<p><span class="smcap">St.</span> Every thing has been achieved

<p><span class="smcap">Vul.</span> This arm at all events is

<p><span class="smcap">St.</span> Now by main force rivet the

<p><span class="smcap">Vul.</span> Alas! alas! Prometheus, I sigh

slip out of this fate.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a

enduring at the hand of the gods! Behold with what indignities
mangled I shall have to wrestle through time of years innumerable.
Such an ignominious bondage hath the new ruler of the immortals
devised against me. Alas! alas! I sigh over the present suffering,
and that which is coming on. How, where must a termination of these
toils arise? And yet what is it I am saying? I know beforehand all
futurity exactly, and no suffering will come upon me unlooked-for.
But I needs must bear my doom as easily as may be, knowing as I do,
that the might of Necessity can not be resisted.</p>

<p>But yet it is not possible for me either to hold my peace, or
not to hold my peace touching these my fortunes. For having
bestowed boons upon mortals, I am enthralled unhappy in these
hardships. And I am he that searched out the source of fire, by
stealth borne-off inclosed in a fennel-rod,<a name="FNanchor_16"
id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>
which has shown itself a teacher of every art to mortals, and a
great resource. Such then as this is the vengeance that I endure
for my trespasses, being riveted in fetters beneath the naked
sky.</p>

<p>Hah! what sound, what ineffable odor<a name="FNanchor_17" id=
"FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
hath been wafted to me, emanating from a god, or from mortal, or of
some intermediate nature? Has there come anyone to the remote rock
as a spectator of my sufferings, or with what intent!<a name=
"FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class=
"fnanchor">18</a> Behold me an ill-fated god in durance, the foe of
Jupiter, him that hath incurred the detestation of all the gods who
frequent the court of Jupiter, by reason of my excessive
friendliness to mortals. Alas! alas! what can this hasty motion of
birds be which I again hear hard by me? The air too is whistling
faintly with the whirrings of pinions. Every thing that approaches
is to me an object of dread.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus.</span> Dread thou nothing; for this
is a friendly band that has come with the fleet rivalry of their
pinions to this <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id=
"Page_18">18</a></span>rock, after prevailing with difficulty on
the mind of our father. And the swiftly-wafting breezes escorted
me; for the echo of the clang of steel pierced to the recess of our
grots, and banished my demure-looking reserve; and I sped without
my sandals in my winged chariot.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Alas! alas! ye offspring of
prolific Thetys, and daughters of Ocean your sire, who rolls around
the whole earth in his unslumbering stream; look upon me, see
clasped in what bonds I shall keep an unenviable watch on the
topmost crags of this ravine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I see, Prometheus: and a fearful
mist full of tears darts over mine eyes, as I looked on thy frame
withering on the rocks<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> in these galling
adamantine fetters: for new pilots are the masters of Olympus; and
Jove, contrary to right, lords it with new laws, and things
aforetime had in reverence he is obliterating.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Oh would that he had sent me
beneath the earth, and below into the boundless Tartarus of Hades
that receives the dead, after savagely securing me in indissoluble
bonds, so that no god at any time, nor any other being, had exulted
in this my doom. Whereas now, hapless one, I, the sport of the
winds, suffer pangs that gladden my foes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Who of the gods is so
hard-hearted as that these things should be grateful to him? Who is
there that sympathizes not with thy sufferings, Jove excepted? He,
indeed, in his wrath, assuming an inflexible temper, is evermore
oppressing the celestial race! nor will he cease before that either
he shall have sated his heart, or some one by some stratagem shall
have seized upon his sovereignity that will be no easy prize.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id=
"Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> In truth hereafter the president
of the immortals<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> shall have need of me,
albeit that I am ignominiously suffering in stubborn shackles, to
discover to him the new plot by which he is to be despoiled of his
sceptre and his honors. But neither shall he win me by the
honey-tongued charms of persuasion; nor will I at any time,
crouching beneath his stern threats, divulge this matter, before he
shall have released me from my cruel bonds, and shall be willing to
yield me retribution for this outrage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Thou indeed both art bold, and
yieldest nought to thy bitter calamities, but art over free in thy
language. But piercing terror is worrying my soul; for I fear for
thy fortunes. How, when will it be thy destiny to make the haven
and see the end of these thy sufferings? for the son of Saturn has
manners that supplication cannot reach, and an inexorable
heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I know that Jupiter is harsh, and
keeps justice to himself; but for all that he shall hereafter be
softened in purpose, when he shall be crushed in this way; and,
after calming his unyielding temper with eagerness will he
hereafter come into league and friendship with me that will eagerly
[welcome him].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Unfold and speak out to us the
whole story, from what accusation has Jupiter seized thee, and is
thus disgracefully and bitterly tormenting thee. Inform us, if thou
be in no respect hurt by the recital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Painful indeed are these things
for me to tell, and painful too for me to hold my peace, and in
every way grievous. As soon as the divinities began discord, and a
feud was stirred up among them with one another&mdash;one <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>party<a
name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21"
class="fnanchor">21</a> wishing to eject Saturn from his throne, in
order forsooth that Jupiter might be king, and others expediting
the reverse, that Jupiter might at no time rule over the gods: then
I, when I gave the best advice, was not able to prevail upon the
Titans, children of Uranus and Terra; but they, contemning in their
stout spirits wily schemes, fancied that without any trouble, and
by dint of main force, they were to win the sovereignty. But it was
not once only that my mother Themis, and Terra, a single person
with many titles, had forewarned me of the way in which the future
would be accomplished; how it was destined, that, not by main
force, nor by the strong hand, but by craft the victors should
prevail. When, however, I explained such points in discourse, they
deigned not to pay me any regard at all. Of the plans which then
presented themselves to me, the best appeared that I should take my
mother and promptly side with Jupiter, who was right willing [to
receive us]. And 'tis by means of my counsels that the murky abyss
of Tartarus overwhelms the antique Saturn, allies and all. After
thus being assisted by me, the tyrant of the gods hath recompensed
me with this foul recompense. For somehow this malady attaches to
tyranny, not to put confidence in its friends. But for your
inquiries upon what charge is it that he outrages me, this I will
make clear. As soon as he has established himself on his father's
throne, he assigns forthwith to the different divinities each his
honors, and he was marshaling in order his empire; but of
woe-begone mortals he made no account, but wished, after <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>having
annihilated the entire race, to plant another new one. And these
schemes no one opposed except myself: But I dared: I ransomed
mortals from being utterly destroyed, and going down to Hades. 'Tis
for this, in truth, that I am bent by sufferings such as these,
agonizing to endure, and piteous to look upon. I that had
compassion for mortals, have myself been deemed unworthy to obtain
this, but mercilessly am thus coerced to order, a spectacle
inglorious to Jupiter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Iron-hearted and formed of rock
too, Prometheus, is he, who condoles not with thy toils: for I
could have wished never to have beheld them, and now, when I behold
them, I am pained in my heart.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Ay, in very deed I am a piteous
object for friends to behold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> And didst thou chance to advance
even beyond this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Yes! I prevented mortals from
foreseeing their doom.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> By finding what remedy for this
malady?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I caused blind hopes to dwell
within them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> In this thou gavest a mighty
benefit to mortals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Over and above these boons,
however, I imparted fire to them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> And do the creatures of a day now
possess bright fire?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Yes&mdash;from which they will
moreover learn thoroughly many arts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch. Is</span> it indeed on charges such as
these that Jupiter is both visiting thee with indignities, and in
no wise grants thee a respite from thy pains? And is no period to
thy toils set before thee?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> None other assuredly, but when it
may please him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> And how shall it be his good
pleasure? What hope is there? Seest thou not that thou didst err?
but how thou<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id=
"Page_22">22</a></span> didst err, I can not relate with pleasure,
and it would be a pain to you. But let us leave these points, and
search thou for some escape from thine agony.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> 'Tis easy, for any one that hath
his foot unentangled by sufferings, both to exhort and to admonish
him that is in evil plight. But I knew all these things willingly,
willingly I erred, I will not gainsay it; and in doing service to
mortals I brought upon myself sufferings. Yet not at all did I
imagine, that, in such a punishment as this, I was to wither away
upon lofty rocks, meeting with this desolate solitary crag. And yet
wail ye not over my present sorrows, but after alighting on the
ground, list ye to the fortune that is coming on, that ye may learn
the whole throughout. Yield to me, yield ye, take ye a share in the
woes of him that is now suffering. Hence in the same way doth
calamity, roaming to and fro, settle down on different
individuals.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Upon those who are nothing loth
hast thou urged this, Prometheus: and now having with light step
quitted my rapidly-wafted chariot-seat, and the pure &aelig;ther,
highway of the feathered race, I will draw near to this rugged
ground: and I long to hear the whole tale of thy sufferings.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class=
"smcap">Ocean</span>.</p>

<p>I am arrived at the end of a long journey,<a name="FNanchor_22"
id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class=
"fnanchor">22</a> having passed over [it] to thee, Prometheus,
guiding this winged steed of mine, swift of pinion, by my will,
without a bit; and, rest assured, I sorrow with thy misfortunes.
For both the tie of kindred thus constrains me, and, relationship
apart, there is no one on whom I would bestow a larger share [of my
regard] than to thyself. And thou shalt know that these words are
sincere, and that it is not in me vainly to do lip-service; for
come, signify to me in what it is necessary for <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>me to assist
thee; for at no time shalt thou say that thou hast a stancher
friend than Oceanus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Hah! what means this? and hast
thou too come to be a witness of my pangs? How hast thou ventured,
after quitting both the stream that bears thy name, and the
rock-roofed self-wrought<a name="FNanchor_23" id=
"FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>
grots, to come into the iron teeming land? Is it that you may
contemplate my misfortunes, and as sympathizing with my woes that
thou hast come? Behold a spectacle, me here the friend of Jupiter,
that helped to establish his sovereignty, with what pains I am bent
by him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> I see, Prometheus, and to thee,
subtle as thou art, I wish to give the best counsel. Know thyself,
and assume to thyself new manners; for among the gods too there is
a new monarch. But if thou wilt utter words thus harsh and whetted,
Jupiter mayhap, though seated far aloft, will hear thee, so that
the present bitterness of sufferings will seem to thee to be
child's play. But, O hapless one! dismiss the passion which thou
feelest, and search for a deliverance from these sufferings of
thine. Old-fashioned maxims these, it may be, I appear to thee to
utter; yet such becomes the wages of the tongue that talks too
proudly. But not even yet art thou humble, nor submittest to ills;
and in addition to those that already beset thee, thou art willing
to bring others upon thee. Yet not, if at least thou takest me for
thy instructor, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24">24</a></span>wilt thou stretch out thy leg against the
pricks; as thou seest that a harsh monarch, and one that is not
subject to control, is lording it. And now I for my part will go,
and will essay, if I be able, to disinthrall thee from these thy
pangs. But be thou still, nor be over impetuous in thy language.
What! knowest thou not exactly, extremely intelligent as thou art,
that punishment is inflicted on a froward tongue?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I give thee joy, because that
thou hast escaped censure, after taking part in and venturing along
with me in all things. And now leave him alone, and let it not
concern thee. For in no wise wilt thou persuade him; for he is not
open to persuasion. And look thou well to it that thou take not
harm thyself by the journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> Thou art far better calculated by
nature to instruct thy neighbors than thyself: I draw my conclusion
from fact, and not from word. But think not for a moment to divert
me from the attempt. For I am confident, yea, I am confident, that
Jupiter will grant me this boon, so as to release thee from these
pangs of thine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> In part I commend thee, and will
by no means at any time cease to do so. For in zeal to serve me
thou lackest nothing. But trouble thyself not; for in vain, without
being of any service to me,<a name="FNanchor_24" id=
"FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
wilt thou labor, if in any respect thou art willing to labor. But
hold thou thy peace, and keep thyself out of harm's way; for I,
though I be in misfortune, would not on this account be willing
that sufferings <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id=
"Page_25">25</a></span>should befall as many as possible. No,
indeed, since also the disasters of my brother Atlas gall my heart,
who is stationed in the western regions, sustaining on his
shoulders the pillar of heaven and of earth, a burden not of easy
grasp. I commiserated too when I beheld the earth-born inmate of
the Cilician caverns, a tremendous prodigy, the hundred-headed
impetuous Typhon, overpowered by force, who withstood all the gods,
hissing slaughter from his hungry jaws; and from his eyes there
flashed a hideous glare, as though he would perforce overthrow the
sovereignty of Jove. But the sleepless shaft of Jupiter came upon
him, the descending thunderbolt breathing forth flame, which scared
him out of his presumptuous bravadoes; for having been smitten to
his very soul he was crumbled to a cinder, and thunder-blasted in
his prowess. And now, a helpless and paralyzed form is he lying
hard by a narrow frith, pressed down beneath the roots of
&AElig;tna.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> And, seated on the topmost
peaks, Vulcan <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id=
"Page_26">26</a></span>forges the molten masses, whence there shall
one day burst forth floods devouring with fell jaws the level
fields of fruitful Sicily: with rage such as this shall Typhon boil
over in hot artillery of a never-glutted fire-breathing storm;
albeit he hath been reduced to ashes by the thunder-bolt of
Jupiter. But thou art no novice, nor needest thou me for thine
instructor. Save thyself as best thou knowest how; but I will
exhaust my present fate until such time as the spirit of Jupiter
shall abate its wrath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> Knowest thou not this then,
Prometheus, that words are the physicians of a distempered
feeling?<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> True, if one seasonably soften
down the heart, and do not with rude violence reduce a swelling
spirit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> Ay, but in foresight along with
boldness<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> what mischief is there that
thou seest to be inherent? inform me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Superfluous trouble and trifling
folly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> Suffer me to sicken in this said
sickness, since 'tis of the highest advantage for one that is wise
not to seem to be wise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> (Not so, for) this trespass will
seem to be mine.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id=
"Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> Thy language is plainly sending
me back to my home.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Lest thy lamentation over me
bring thee into ill-will.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> What with him who hath lately
seated himself on the throne that ruleth over all?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Beware of him lest at any time
his heart be moved to wrath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> Thy disaster, Prometheus, is my
monitor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Away! withdraw thee, keep thy
present determination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Oc.</span> On me, hastening to start, hast
thou urged this injunction; for my winged quadruped flaps with his
pinions the smooth track of &aelig;ther; and blithely would he
recline his limbs in his stalls at home.</p>

<p class="four">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Ocean.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I bewail thee for thy lost fate,
Prometheus. A flood of trickling tears from my yielding eyes has
bedewed my cheek with its humid gushings; for Jupiter commanding
this thine unenviable doom by laws of his own, displays his spear
appearing superior o'er the gods of old.<a name="FNanchor_28" id=
"FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
And now the whole land echoes with wailing&mdash;they wail thy
stately and time-graced honors, and those of thy brethren; and all
they of mortal race that occupy a dwelling neighboring on hallowed
Asia<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> mourn with thy
deeply-deplorable sufferings: the virgins that dwell in the land of
Colchis too, fearless of the fight, and the Scythian horde who
possess the most remote regions of earth around lake M&aelig;otis;
and the war-like flower of Arabia,<a name="FNanchor_30" id=
"FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a>
who occupy a fortress on the craggy <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>heights in the neighborhood of
Caucasus, a warrior-host, clamoring amid sharply-barbed spears.</p>

<p>One other god only, indeed, have I heretofore beheld in
miseries, the Titan Atlas, subdued by the galling of adamantine<a
name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31"
class="fnanchor">31</a> bonds, who evermore in his back is groaning
beneath<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> the excessive mighty mass of
the pole of heaven. And the billow of the deep roars as it falls in
cadence, the depth moans, and the murky vault of Hades rumbles
beneath the earth, and the fountains of the pure streaming rivers
wail for his piteous pains.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Do not, I pray you, suppose that
I am holding my peace from pride or self-will; but by reflection am
I gnawed to the heart, seeing myself thus ignominiously
entreated.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> And yet who but myself
defined completely the prerogative for these same new gods? But on
these matters I say nothing, for I should speak to you already
acquainted with these things. But for the misfortunes that existed
among mortals, hear how I made them, that aforetime lived as
infants, rational and possessed of intellect.<a name="FNanchor_34"
id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
And I will tell you, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id=
"Page_29">29</a></span>having no complaint against mankind, as
detailing the kindness of the boons which I bestowed upon them:
they who at first seeing saw in vain, hearing they heard not. But,
like to the forms of dreams, for a long time they used to huddle
together all things at random, and naught knew they about
brick-built<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> and sun-ward houses, nor
carpentry; but they dwelt in the excavated earth like tiny emmets
in the sunless depths of caverns. And they had no sure sign either
of winter, or of flowery spring, or of fruitful summer; but they
used to do every thing without judgment, until indeed I showed to
them the risings of the stars and their settings,<a name=
"FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class=
"fnanchor">36</a> hard to be discerned.</p>

<p>And verily I discover for them Numbers, the surpassing all
inventions,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> the combinations too of
letters, and Memory, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id=
"Page_30">30</a></span>effective mother-nurse of all arts. I also
first bound with yokes beasts submissive to the collars; and in
order that with their bodies they might become to mortals
substitutes for their severest toils, I brought steeds under cars
obedient to the rein,<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a
href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> a glory to pompous
luxury. And none other than I invented the canvas-winged chariots
of mariners that roam over the ocean. After discovering for mortals
such inventions, wretch that I am, I myself have no device whereby
I may escape from my present misery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Thou hast suffered unseemly ills,
baulked in thy discretion thou art erring; and like a bad
physician, having fallen into a distemper thou art faint-hearted,
and, in reference to thyself, thou canst not discover by what
manner of medicines thou mayest be cured.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> When thou hearest the rest of my
tale, thou wilt wonder still more what arts and resources I
contrived. For the greatest&mdash;if that any one fell into a
distemper, there was no remedy, neither in the way of diet, nor of
liniment, nor of potion, but for lack of medicines they used to
pine away to skeletons, before that I pointed out to them the
composition<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> of mild remedies, wherewith
they ward off all their maladies. Many modes too of the divining
art did I classify, and was the first that discriminated among
dreams those which are destined to be a true vision; obscure vocal
omens<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> too I made <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>known to
them; tokens also incidental on the road, and the flight of birds
of crooked talons I clearly defined, both those that are in their
nature auspicious, and the ill-omened, and what the kind of life
that each leads, and what are their feuds and endearments<a name=
"FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class=
"fnanchor">41</a> and intercourse one with another: the smoothness
too of the entrails, and what hue they must have to be acceptable
to the gods, the various happy formations of the gall and liver,
and the limbs enveloped in fat: and having roasted the long chine I
pointed out to mortals the way into an abstruse art; and I brought
to light the fiery symbols<a name="FNanchor_42" id=
"FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
that were aforetime wrapt in darkness. Such indeed were these
boons; and the gains to mankind that were hidden under ground,
brass, iron, silver, and gold&mdash;who could assert that he had
discovered before me? No one, I well know, who does not mean to
idly babble. And in one brief sentence learn the whole at
once&mdash;All arts among the human race are from Prometheus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Do not now serve the human race
beyond what is profitable, nor disregard thyself in thy distress:
since I have good hopes that thou shalt yet be liberated from these
shackles, and be not one whit less powerful than Jove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Not at all in this way is Fate,
that brings events to their consummation ordained to accomplish
these things: but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id=
"Page_32">32</a></span>after having been bent by countless
sufferings and calamities, thus am I to escape from my shackles.
And art is far less powerful than necessity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Who then is the pilot of
necessity?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> The triform Fates and the
remembering Furies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Is Jupiter then less powerful
than these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Most certainly he can not at any
rate escape his doom.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a
href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Why, what is doomed for Jupiter
but to reign for evermore?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> This thou mayest not yet learn,
and do not press it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> 'Tis surely some solemn mystery
that thou veilest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Make mention of some other
matter; it is by no means seasonable to proclaim this; but it must
be shrouded in deepest concealment; for it is by keeping this
secret that I am to escape from my ignominious shackles and
miseries.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Never may Jupiter, who directs
all things, set his might in opposition to my purpose: nor may I be
backward in attending upon the gods at their hallowed banquets, at
which oxen are sacrificed, beside the restless stream of my sire
Ocean; and may I not trespass in my words; but may this feeling
abide by me and never melt away. Sweet it is to pass through a long
life in confident hopes, making the spirits swell with bright
merriment; but I shudder as I behold thee harrowed by agonies
incalculable.... For not standing in awe of Jupiter, thou,
Prometheus, in thy self-will honorest mortals to excess. Come, my
friend, own how boonless was the boon; say where is any aid? What
relief can come from the creatures of a day? Sawest thou not the
powerless weakness, nought better than a dream, in which <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>the
blind race of men is entangled? Never shall at any time the schemes
of mortals evade the harmonious system of Jupiter. This I learned
by witnessing thy destructive fate, Prometheus. And far different
is this strain that now flits toward me from the hymen&aelig;al
chant which I raised around the baths and thy couch with the
consent<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> of nuptials, when, after
having won Hesione with thy love-tokens, thou didst conduct her our
sister to be thy bride, the sharer of thy bed.</p>

<p>What land is this? what race? whom shall I say I here behold
storm-tossed in rocky fetters? Of what trespass is the retribution
destroying thee? Declare to me into what part of earth I forlorn
have roamed. Ah me! alas! alas! again the hornet<a name=
"FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class=
"fnanchor">46</a> stings me miserable: O earth avert<a name=
"FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class=
"fnanchor">47</a> the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id=

"FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class=
"fnanchor">48</a> I am terrified at the sight of the neatherd of
thousand eyes, for he is journeying on, keeping a cunning glance,
whom not even after death does earth conceal; but issuing forth
from among the departed he chases me miserable, and he makes me to
wander famished along the shingled strand, while the sounding
wax-compacted pipe drones on a sleepy strain. Oh! oh! ye powers!
Oh! powers! whither do my far-roaming wanderings convey me? In
what, in what, O son of Saturn, hast thou, having found me
transgressing, shackled me in these pangs? Ah! ah! and art thus
wearing out a timorous wretch frenzied with sting-driven fear. Burn
me with fire, or bury me in earth, or give me for food to the
monsters of the deep, and grudge me not these prayers, O king!
Amply have my much-traversed wanderings harassed me; nor can I
discover how I may avoid pain. Hearest thou the address of the
ox-horned maiden?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> How can I fail to hear the damsel
that is frenzy-driven by the hornet, the daughter of Inachus, who
warms <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id=
"Page_35">35</a></span>the heart of Jupiter with love, and now,
abhorred of Juno, is driven perforce courses of exceeding
length?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> From whence utterest thou the
name of my father? Tell me, the woe-begone, who thou art, who, I
say, O hapless one, that hast thus correctly accosted me miserable,
and hast named the heaven-inflicted disorder which wastes me,
fretting with its maddening stings? Ah! ah! violently driven by the
famishing tortures of my boundings have I come a victim to the
wrathful counsels of Juno. And of the ill-fated who are there, ah
me! that endure woes such as mine? But do thou clearly define to me
what remains for me to suffer, what salve:<a name="FNanchor_49" id=
"FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
what remedy there is for my malady, discover to me, if at all thou
knowest: speak, tell it to the wretched roaming damsel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I will tell thee clearly every
thing which thou desirest to learn, not interweaving riddles, but
in plain language, as it is right to open the mouth to friends.
Thou seest him that bestowed fire on mortals, Prometheus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> O thou that didst dawn a common
benefit upon mortals, wretched Prometheus, as penance for what
offense art thou thus suffering?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I have just ceased lamenting my
own pangs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Wilt thou not then accord to me
this boon?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Say what it is that thou art
asking, for thou mightest learn everything from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Say who it was that bound thee
fast in this cleft?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> The decree of Jupiter, but the
hand of Vulcan.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> And for what offenses art thou
paying the penalty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Thus much alone is all that I can
clearly explain to thee.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36">36</a></span><span class="smcap">Io.</span> At least, in
addition to this, discover what time shall be to me woe-worn the
limit of my wanderings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Not to learn this is better for
thee than to learn it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Yet conceal not from me what I am
to endure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Nay, I grudge thee not this
gift.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Why then delayest thou to utter
the whole?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> 'Tis not reluctance, but I am
loth to shock thy feelings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Do not be more anxious on my
account than is agreeable to me.<a name="FNanchor_50" id=
"FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class=
"fnanchor">50</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Since thou art eager, I must
needs tell thee: attend thou.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Not yet, however; but grant me
also a share of the pleasure. Let us first learn the malady of this
maiden, from her own tale of her destructive<a name="FNanchor_51"
id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
fortunes; but, for the sequel of her afflictions let her be
informed by thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> It is thy part, Io, to minister
to the gratification of these now before thee, both for all other
reasons, and that they are the sisters of thy father. Since to weep
and lament over misfortunes, when one is sure to win a tear from
the listeners, is well worth the while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> I know not how I should disobey
you; and in a plain tale ye shall learn everything that ye desire;
and yet I am pained even to speak of the tempest that hath been
sent upon me from heaven, and the utter marring of my person,
whence it suddenly came upon me, a wretched creature! For nightly
visions thronging to my maiden chamber, would entice me <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>with
smooth words: "O damsel, greatly fortunate, why dost thou live long
time in maidenhood, when it is in thy power to achieve a match the
very noblest? for Jupiter is fired by thy charms with the shaft of
passion, and longs with thee to share in love. But do not, my
child, spurn away from thee the couch of Jupiter; but go forth to
Lerna's fertile mead, to the folds and ox-stalls of thy father,
that the eye of Jove may have respite from its longing." By dreams
such as these was I unhappy beset every night, until at length I
made bold to tell my sire of the dreams that haunted me by night.
And he dispatched both to Pytho and Dodona<a name="FNanchor_52" id=
"FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
many a messenger to consult the oracles, that he might learn what
it behooved him to do or say, so as to perform what was
well-pleasing to the divinities. And they came bringing a report
back of oracles ambiguously worded, indistinct, and obscurely
delivered. But at last a clear response came to Inachus, plainly
charging and directing him to thrust me forth both from my home and
my country, to stray an outcast to earth's remotest limits; and
that, if he would not, a fiery-visaged thunder-bolt would come from
Jupiter, and utterly blot out his whole race. Overcome by oracles
of Loxias such as these, unwilling did me expel and exclude me
unwilling from his dwelling: but the bit of Jupiter<a name=
"FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class=
"fnanchor">53</a> perforce constrained him to do this. And
straightway my person and my mind were distorted, and horned, as ye
see, stung by the keenly-biting fly, I rushed with maniac boundings
to the sweet stream of Cerchneia, and the fountain<a name=
"FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class=
"fnanchor">54</a> of Lerna; and the earth-born neatherd Argus of
un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id=
"Page_38">38</a></span>tempered fierceness, kept dogging me,
peering after my footsteps with thick-set eyes. Him, however, an
unlooked-for sudden fate bereaved of life; but I hornet-stricken am
driven by the scourge divine from land to land. Thou hearest what
has taken place, and if thou art able to say what pangs there
remain for me, declare them; and do not, compassionating me, warm
me with false tales, for I pronounce fabricated statements to be a
most foul malady.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Ah! ah! forbear! Alas! Never,
never did I expect that a tale [so] strange would come to my ears,
or that sufferings thus horrible to witness and horrible to endure,
outrages, terrors with their two-edged goad, would chill my spirit.
Alas! alas! O Fate! Fate! I shudder as I behold the condition of
Io.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Prematurely, however, are thou
sighing, and art full of terror. Hold, until thou shalt also have
heard the residue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Say on; inform me fully: to the
sick indeed it is sweet to get a clear knowledge beforehand of the
sequel of their sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Your former desire at any rate ye
gained from me easily; for first of all ye desired to be informed
by her recital of the affliction<a name="FNanchor_55" id=
"FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>
that attaches to herself. Now give ear to the rest, what sort of
sufferings it is the fate of this young damsel before you to
undergo at the hand of Juno: thou too, seed of Inachus, lay to
heart my words, that thou mayest be fully informed of the
termination of thy journey. In the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>first place, after turning
thyself from this spot toward the rising of the sun, traverse
unplowed fields; and thou wilt reach the wandering Scythians, who,
raised from off the around, inhabit wicker dwellings on
well-wheeled cars, equipped with distant-shooting bows; to whom
thou must not draw near, but pass on out of their land, bringing
thy feet to approach the rugged roaring shores. And on thy left
hand dwell the Chalybes, workers of iron, of whom thou must needs
beware, for they are barbarous, and not accessible to strangers.
And thou wilt come to the river Hybristes,<a name="FNanchor_56" id=
"FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
not falsely so called, which do not thou cross, for it is not easy
to ford, until thou shalt have come to Caucasus itself, loftiest of
mountains, where from its very brow the river spouts forth its
might. And surmounting its peaks that neighbor on the stars, thou
must go into a southward track, where thou wilt come to the
man-detesting host of Amazons, who hereafter shall make a
settlement, Themiscyra, on the banks of Thermodon, where lies the
rugged Salmydessian sea-gorge, a host by mariners hated, a
step-dame to ships; and they will conduct thee on thy way, and that
right willingly. Thou shalt come too to the Cimmerian isthmus, hard
by the very portals of a lake, with narrow passage, which thou
undauntedly must leave, and cross the M&aelig;otic frith; and there
shall exist for evermore among mortals a famous legend concerning
thy passage, and after thy name it shall be called the Bosphorus;
and after having quitted European ground, thou shalt come to the
Asiatic continent. Does not then the sovereign of the gods seem to
you to be violent alike toward all things? for he a god lusting to
enjoy the charms of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id=
"Page_40">40</a></span>this mortal fair one, hath cast upon her
these wanderings. And a bitter wooer, maiden, hast thou found for
thy hand; for think that the words which thou hast now heard are
not even for a prelude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Woe is me! ah! ah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Thou too in thy turn<a name=
"FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class=
"fnanchor">57</a> art crying out and moaning: what wilt thou do
then, when thou learnest the residue of thy ills?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> What! hast thou aught of
suffering left to tell to her?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Ay, a tempestuous sea of baleful
calamities.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> What gain then is it for me to
live? but why did I not quickly fling myself from this rough
precipice, that dashing on the plain I had rid myself of all my
pangs? for better is it once to die, than all one's days to suffer
ill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Verily thou wouldst hardly bear
the agonies of me to whom it is not doomed to die. For this would
be an escape from sufferings. But now there is no limit set to my
hardships, until Jove shall have been deposed from his tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> What! is it possible that Jupiter
should ever fall from his power?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Glad wouldst thou be, I ween, to
witness this event.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> And how not so, I, who through
Jupiter am suffering ill?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Well, then, thou mayest assure
thyself of these things that they are so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> By whom is he to be despoiled of
his sceptre of tyranny.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Himself, by his own senseless
counsels.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> In what manner? Specify it, if
there be no harm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> He will make such a match as he
shall one day rue.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a
href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id=
"Page_41">41</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Celestial or mortal? If it may be
spoken, tell me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> But why ask its nature? for it is
not a matter that I can communicate to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Is it by a consort that he is to
be ejected from his throne?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Yes, surely, one that shall give
birth to a son mightier than the father.<a name="FNanchor_59" id=
"FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class=
"fnanchor">59</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> And has he no refuge from this
misfortune?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Not he, indeed, before at any
rate I after being liberated from my shackles&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Who, then, is he that shall
liberate thee in despite of Jupiter?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> It is ordained that it shall be
one of thine own descendants.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> How sayest thou? Shall child of
mine release thee from thy ills?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Yes, the third of thy lineage in
addition to ten other generations.<a name="FNanchor_60" id=
"FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class=
"fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id=
"Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> This prophecy of thine is no
longer easy for me to form a guess upon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Nor seek thou to know over well
thine own pangs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Do not, after proffering me a
benefit, withhold it from me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I will freely grant thee one of
two disclosures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Explain to me first of what sort
they are, and allow me my choice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> I allow it thee; for choose
whether I shall clearly tell to thee the residue of thy troubles,
or who it is that is to be my deliverer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Of these twain do thou vouchsafe
to bestow the one boon on this damsel, and the other on me, and
disdain thou not my request. To her tell the rest of her
wanderings, and to me him that is to deliver thee; for this I long
[to hear].</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Seeing that ye are eagerly bent
upon it, I will not oppose your wishes, so as not to utter every
thing as much as ye desire. To thee in the first place, Io, will I
describe thy mazy wanderings, which do thou engrave on the
recording tablets of thy mind.</p>

<p>When thou shalt have crossed the stream that is the boundary of
the Continents, to the ruddy realms of morn where walks the sun<a
name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61"
class="fnanchor">61</a> ... having passed over the roaring swell of
the sea, until thou shalt reach the Gorgonian plains of Cisthene,
where dwell the Phorcides, three swan-like aged damsels, that
possess one eye in common, that have but a single tooth, on whom
ne'er doth the sun glance with his rays, nor the nightly moon. And
hard <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id=
"Page_43">43</a></span>by are three winged sisters of these, the
snake-tressed Gorgons, abhorred of mortals, whom none of human race
can look upon and retain the breath of life.<a name="FNanchor_62"
id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>
Such is this caution<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a
href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> which I mention to
thee. Now lend an ear to another hideous spectacle; for be on thy
guard against the keen-fanged hounds of Jupiter that never bark,
the gryphons, and the cavalry host of one-eyed Arimaspians, who
dwell on the banks of the gold-gushing fount, the stream of Pluto:
go not thou nigh to these. And thou wilt reach a far-distant land,
a dark tribe, who dwell close upon the fountains of the sun, where
is the river &AElig;thiops. Along the banks of this wend thy way,
until thou shalt have reached the cataract where from the Bybline
mountains the Nile pours forth his hallowed, grateful stream. This
will guide thee to the triangular land of the Nile; where at
length, Io, it is ordained for thee and thy children after thee to
found the distant colony. And if aught of this is obscurely
uttered, and hard to be understood, question me anew, and learn it
thoroughly and clearly: as for leisure, I have more than I
desire.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> If indeed thou hast aught to tell
of her baleful wanderings, that still remains or hath been omitted,
say on; but if thou hast told the whole, give to us in our turn the
favor which we ask, and you, perchance, remember.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> She hath heard the full term of
her journeying. And that she may know that she hath not been
listening to me in vain, I will relate what hardships she endured
before she came hither, giving her this as a sure proof of my
state<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id=
"Page_44">44</a></span>ments. The very great multitude indeed of
words I shall omit, and I will proceed to the termination itself of
thine aberrations. For after that thou hadst come to the Molossian
plains, and about the lofty ridge of Dodona, where is the oracular
seat of Thesprotian Jove, and a portent passing belief, the
speaking oaks, by which thou wast clearly and without any ambiguity
saluted illustrious spouse of Jove that art to be; if aught of this
hath any charms for thee.<a name="FNanchor_64" id=
"FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
Thence madly rushing along the seaside track, thou didst dart away
to the vast bay of Rhea, from which thou art tempest-driven in
retrograde courses: and in time to come, know well that the gulf of
the deep shall be called IO-nian, a memorial of thy passage to all
mortals. These hast thou as tokens of my intelligence, how that it
perceives somewhat beyond what appears.</p>

<p>The rest I shall tell both to you and to her in common, after
reaching the very identical track of my former narrative. There is
on the land's utmost verge a city Canopus, hard by the Nile's very
mouth and alluvial dike; on this spot Jupiter at length makes thee
sane by merely soothing and touching thee with his unalarming hand.
And named after the progeniture of Jupiter<a name="FNanchor_65" id=
"FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
thou shalt give birth to swarthy Epaphus, who shall reap the
harvest of all the land which the wide-streaming Nile waters. But
fifth in descent <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id=
"Page_45">45</a></span>from him a generation of fifty virgins shall
again come to Argos, not of their own accord, fleeing from
incestuous wedlock with their cousins; and these with fluttering
hearts, like falcons left not far behind by doves, shall come
pursuing marriage such as should not be pursued, but heaven shall
be jealous over their persons;<a name="FNanchor_66" id=
"FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>
and Pelasgia shall receive them after being crushed by a deed of
night-fenced daring, wrought by woman's hand; for each bride shall
bereave her respective husband of life, having dyed in their
throats<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> a sword of twin sharp edge.
Would that in guise like this Venus might visit my foes! But
tenderness shall soften one<a name="FNanchor_68" id=
"FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> of
the maidens, so that she shall not slay the partner of her couch,
but shall be blunt in her resolve; and of the two alternatives she
shall choose the former, to be called a coward rather than a
murderess. She in Argos shall give birth to a race of kings. There
needs a long discourse to detail these things distinctly; but from
this seed be sure shall spring a dauntless warrior renowned in
archery, who shall set me free from these toils. Such predictions
did my aged mother <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id=
"Page_46">46</a></span>the Titaness Themis rehearse to me; but how
and when&mdash;to tell this requires a long detail, and thou in
knowing it all wouldst be in nought a gainer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Io.</span> Eleleu! Eleleu! Once more the
spasm<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> and maddening frenzies
inflame me&mdash;and the sting of the hornet, wrought by no fire,<a
name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70"
class="fnanchor">70</a> envenoms me; and with panic my heart throbs
violently against my breast. My eyes, too, are rolling in a mazy
whirl, and I am carried out of my course by the raging blast of
madness, having no control of tongue, but my troubled words dash
idly against the surges of loathsome calamity.</p>

<p class="four">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Io.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Wise was the man, ay, wise
indeed, who first weighed well this maxim, and with his tongue
published it abroad, that to match in one's own degree is best by
far;<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> and that one who lives by
labor should woo the hand neither of any that have waxed wanton in
opulence, nor of such as pride themselves on nobility of birth.
Never, O Destines,<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a
href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> never ... may ye behold
me approaching as a partner the couch of Jupiter: nor may I be<a
name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73"
class="fnanchor">73</a> brought to the arms of any bridegroom from
among the sons of heaven: for I am in dread when I behold the
maiden Io, contented with no mortal lover, greatly marred by
wearisome wanderings at the hand of Juno. For myself,
indeed&mdash;inasmuch as wedlock on one's own level is free from
apprehension&mdash;I feel no alarm.<a name="FNanchor_74" id=
"FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>
And oh! never may the love of the mightier <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>gods cast on me a glance
that none can elude. This at least is a war without a conflict,
accomplishing things impossible:<a name="FNanchor_75" id=
"FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>
nor know I what might become of me, for I see not how I could evade
the counsel of Jove.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Yet truly shall Jove, albeit he
is self-willed in his temper, be lowly, in such<a name=
"FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class=
"fnanchor">76</a> wedlock is he prepared to wed, as shall hurl him
out of his sovereignty and off his throne a forgotten thing; and
the curse of his father Saturn shall then at length find entire
consummation, which he imprecated when he was deposed from his
ancient throne. From disasters such as these there is no one of the
gods besides myself that can clearly disclose to him a way of
escape. I know this, and by what means. Wherefore let him rest on
in his presumption, putting confidence in his thunders aloft,
brandishing in his hand a fire-breathing bolt. For not one jot
shall these suffice to save him from falling dishonored in a
downfall beyond endurance; such an antagonist is he now with his
own hands preparing against himself, a portent that shall baffle
all resistance; who shall invent a flame more potent than the
lightning, and a mighty din that shall surpass the thunder; and
shall shiver the ocean trident, that earth-convulsing pest, the
spear of Neptune. And when he hath stumbled upon this mischief, he
shall be taught how great is the difference between sovereignty and
slavery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Thou forsooth art boding against
Jupiter the things thou wishest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Things that shall come to pass,
and that I desire to boot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id=

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> And are we to expect that any one
will get the mastery of Jove?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Ay, and pangs too yet harder to
bear than these [of mine] shall he sustain.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> And how is it that thou art not
dismayed blurting out words such as these?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Why at what should I be terrified
to whom it is not destined to die?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Yet perchance he will provide for
thee affliction more grievous than even this.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Let him do it then, all is
foreseen by me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> They that do homage to Adrasteia
are wise.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Do homage, make thy prayer,
cringe to each ruler of the day. I care for Jove less than nothing;
let him do, let him lord it for this brief span, e'en as he list,
for not long shall he rule over the gods. But no more, for I descry
Jove's courier close at hand, the menial of the new monarch: beyond
all [doubt] he has come to announce to us some news.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Enter</i> <span class=
"smcap">Mercury</span>.</p>

<p>Thee, the contriver, thee full of gall and bitterness, who
sinned against the gods by bestowing their honors on creatures of a
day, the thief of fire, I address. The Sire commands thee to
divulge of what nuptials it is that thou art vaunting, by means of
which he is to be put down from his power. And these things,
moreover, without any kind of mystery, but each exactly as it is,
do thou tell out; and entail not upon me, Prometheus, a double
journey; and thou perceivest that by such conduct Jove is not
softened.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> High sounding, i'faith, and full
of haughtiness is thy speech, as beseems a lackey of the gods.
Young in years, ye are young in power;<a name="FNanchor_77" id=
"FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>
and ye fancy forsooth that ye dwell in <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>a citadel impregnable
against sorrow. Have I not known two monarchs<a name="FNanchor_78"
id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
dethroned from it? And the third that now is ruler I shall also see
expelled most foully and most quickly. Seem I to thee in aught to
be dismayed at, and to crouch beneath the new gods? Widely, ay
altogether, do I come short [of such feelings]. But do thou hie
thee back the way by which thou camest: for not one tittle shalt
thou learn of the matter on which thou questionest me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Yet truly 'twas by such
self-will even before now that thou didst bring thyself to such a
calamitous mooring.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Be well assured that I would not
barter my wretched plight for thy drudgery; for better do I deem it
to be a lackey to this rock, than to be born the confidential
courier of father Jove. Thus is it meet to repay insult in
kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Thou seemest to revel in thy
present state.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Revel! Would that I might see my
foes thus reveling, and among these I reckon thee.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> What dost thou impute to me also
any blame for thy mischances?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> In plain truth, I detest all the
gods, as many of them as, after having received benefits at my
hands, are iniquitously visiting me with evils.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> I hear thee raving with no
slight disorder.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id=
"Page_50">50</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Disordered I would be, if
disorder it be to loathe one's foes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Thou wouldst be beyond
endurance, wert thou in prosperity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Woe's me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> This word of thine Jove knows
not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Ay, but Time as he grows old
teaches all things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> And yet verily thou knowest not
yet how to be discreet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> No i'faith, or I should not have
held parley with thee, menial as thou art.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Thou seemest disposed to tell
nought of the things which the Sire desires.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> In sooth, being under obligation
as I am to him, I am bound to return his favor.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Thou floutest me, forsooth, as
if I were a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Why, art thou not a boy, and yet
sillier than one, if thou lookest to obtain any information from
me? There is no outrage nor artifice by which Jupiter shall bring
me to utter this, before my torturing shackles shall have been
loosened. Wherefore let his glowing lightning be hurled, and with
the white feathered shower of snow, and thunderings beneath the
earth let him confound and embroil the universe; for nought of
these things shall bend me so much as even to say by whom it is
doomed that he shall be put down from his sovereignty.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Consider now whether this
determination seems availing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Long since has this been
considered and resolved.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Resolve, O vain one, resolve at
length in consideration of thy present sufferings to come to thy
right senses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> Thou troublest me with thine
admonitions as vainly as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id=

"FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class=

affrighted by the purpose of Jupiter, shall become womanish, and
shall importune the object whom I greatly loathe, with effeminate
upliftings of my hands, to release me from these shackles: I want
much of that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> With all that I have said I seem
to be speaking to no purpose; for not one whit art thou melted or
softened in thy heart by entreaties, but art champing the bit like
a colt fresh yoked, and struggling against the reins. But on the
strength of an impotent scheme art thou thus violent; for obstinacy
in one not soundly wise, itself by itself availeth less than
nothing. And mark, if thou art not persuaded by my words, what a
tempest and three-fold surge of ills, from which there is no
escape, will come upon thee. For in the first place the Sire will
shiver this craggy cleft with thunder and the blaze of his bolt,
and will overwhelm thy body, and a clasping arm of rock shall bear
thee up. And after thou shalt have passed through to its close, a
long space of time, thou shalt come back into the light; and a
winged hound of Jupiter, a blood-thirsting eagle, shall ravenously
mangle thy huge lacerated frame, stealing upon thee an unbidden
guest, and [tarrying] all the live-long day, and shall banquet his
fill on the black viands<a name="FNanchor_80" id=
"FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> of
thy liver. To such <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id=
"Page_52">52</a></span>labors look thou for no termination, until
some god shall appear as a substitute in thy pangs, and shall be
willing to go both to gloomy Hades, and to the murky depths around
Tartarus. Wherefore advise thee, since this is no fictitious vaunt,
but uttered in great earnestness; for the divine mouth knows not
how to utter falsehood, but will bring every word to pass. But do
thou look around and reflect, and never for a moment deem
pertinacity better than discretion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> To us, indeed, Mercury seems to
propose no unseasonable counsel; for he bids thee to abandon thy
recklessness, and seek out wise consideration. Be persuaded; for to
a wise man 'tis disgraceful to err.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pr.</span> To me already well aware of it
hath this fellow urged his message; but for a foe to suffer
horribly at the hands of foes is no indignity. Wherefore let the
doubly-pointed wreath of his fire be hurled at me, and ether be
torn piecemeal by thunder, and spasm of savage blasts; and let the
wind rock earth from her base, roots and all, and with stormy surge
mingle in rough tide the billow of the deep and the paths of the
stars; and fling my body into black Tartarus, with a whirl, in the
stern eddies of necessity. Yet by no possible means shall he visit
me with death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Resolutions and expressions, in
truth, such as these of thine, one may hear from maniacs. For in
what point doth his fate fall short of insanity?<a name=
"FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class=

at any rate, that sympathize with him in his sufferings, withdraw
hence speedily some-whither from this spot, lest the harsh
bellowing of the thunder smite you with idiotcy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Utter and advise me to something
else, in which too thou mayest prevail upon me; for in this, be
sure, thou <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id=

How is it that thou urgest me to practice baseness? Along with him
here I am willing to endure what is destined, for I have learned to
abhor traitors; and there is no evil which I hold in greater
abomination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mer.</span> Well, then, bear in mind the
things of which I forewarn you: and do not, when ye have been
caught in the snares of At&egrave;, throw the blame on fortune, nor
ever at any time say that Jove cast you into unforeseen calamity:
no indeed, but ye your ownselves: for well aware, and not on a
sudden, nor in ignorance, will ye be entangled by your
senselessness in an impervious net of At&egrave;.</p>

<p class="five"><span class="smcap">Time.</span> Early in the
morning; the length of the action can scarcely be fixed with
absolute certainty. It certainly did not exceed twelve hours.</p>

<p class="five">The expedition of "the Seven" against Thebes is

<p><span class="smcap">Eteocles.</span> Citizens of Cadmus! it is
fitting that he should speak things seasonable who has the care of
affairs on the poop of a state, managing the helm, not lulling his
eyelids in slumber. For if we succeed, the gods are the cause; but
if, on the other hand (which heaven forbid), mischance should
befall, Eteocles alone would be much bruited through the city by
the townsmen in strains clamorous and in wailings, of which may
Jove prove rightly called the Averter to<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span> the city of the
Cadm&aelig;ans.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> And now it behooves
you&mdash;both him who still falls short of youth in its prime, and
him who in point of age has passed his youth, nurturing the ample
vigor of his frame and each that is in his prime,<a name=
"FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class=
"fnanchor">84</a> as is best fitting&mdash;to succor the city, and
the altars of your country's gods, so that their honors may never
be obliterated; your children too, and your motherland, most
beloved nurse; for she, taking fully on herself the whole trouble
of your rearing, nurtured you when infants crawling on her kindly
soil, for her trusty shield-bearing citizens, that ye might be
[trusty<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a>] for this service. And, for
the present indeed, up to this day, the deity inclines in our
favor; since to us now all this time beleaguered the war for the
most part, by divine allotment, turns out well. But now, as saith
the seer, the feeder<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a
href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> of birds, revolving in
ear and thoughts, without the use of fire, the oracular birds with
unerring art&mdash;he, lord of such divining powers, declares that
the main Ach&aelig;an assault is this night proclaimed,<a name=
"FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class=
"fnanchor">87</a> and [that the Ach&aelig;ans] attempt the
city.</p>

<p>But haste ye all, both to the battlements and the gates of the
tower works; On! in full panoply throng the breastworks, and take
your stations on the platforms of the towers, and, making stand at
the outlets of the gates, be of good <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>heart, nor be over-dismayed at
the rabble of the aliens; God will give a happy issue. Moreover, I
have also dispatched scouts and observers of the army, who will
not, I feel assured, loiter on their way; and when I have had
intelligence from these, I shall, in no point, be surprised by
stratagem.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Messenger.</span>&mdash;Most gallant
Eteocles! sovereign of the Cadm&aelig;ans, I have come bearing a
clear account of the matters yonder, from the army; and I myself am
eye-witness of the facts. For seven chieftains, impetuous leaders
of battalions, cutting a bull's throat,<a name="FNanchor_88" id=
"FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
over an iron-rimmed shield,<a name="FNanchor_89" id=
"FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a>
and touching with their hands the gore of the bull, by oath have
called to witness<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a
href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Mars, Enyo, and Terror,
that delights in bloodshed, that either having wrought the
demolition of our city they will make havoc of the town of the
Cadm&aelig;ans, or having fallen will steep this land of ours in
gore. Memorials too of themselves, to their parents at home, were
they with their hands hanging in festoons<a name="FNanchor_91" id=
"FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> at
the car of Adrastus, dropping a tear, but no sound of complaint
passed their lips.<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a
href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> For their iron-hearted
spirit glowing with valor was panting, as of lions that glare
battle. And the report of these my tidings is not retarded by
sluggishness. But I left them in the very act of casting lots, that
so each of them, obtaining his post by lot, might lead on his
battalion to our gates. Wherefore do thou with all speed marshal at
the outlets of the gates the bravest men, the chosen of our city;
for already the host of Argives hard at hand armed
cap-&agrave;-pi&eacute; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id=
"Page_57">57</a></span>is in motion, is speeding onward, and white
foam is staining the plain with its drippings from the lungs of
their chargers. Do thou then, like the clever helmsman of a vessel,
fence<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> our city before the breath
of Mars burst like a hurricane upon it, for the main-land billow of
their host is roaring. And for these measures do thou seize the
very earliest opportunity; for the sequel I will keep my eye a
faithful watch by day, and thou, knowing from the clearness of my
detail the movements of those without, shalt be unscathed.</p>

foemen; for Argives are encircling the fortress of Cadmus; and I
feel a dread of martial arms, and the bits which are fastened
through the jaws of their horses are knelling slaughter. And seven

taking their stand at our seventh gate,<a name="FNanchor_103" id=

our city, and an encouragement to this beleagured force, for you to
fall before the statues of our tutelary gods, to shriek, to
yell&mdash;O ye abominations of the wise. Neither in woes nor in
welcome prosperity may I be associated with womankind; for when
woman prevails, her audacity is more than one can live with; and
when she is affrighted, she is a still greater mischief to her home
and city. Even now, having brought upon your countrymen this
pell-mell flight, ye have, by your outcries, spread dastard
cowardice, and ye are serving, as best ye may, the interests of
those without, but we within our walls are suffering capture at our
own hands; such blessings will you have if you live along with
women. Wherefore if any one give not ear to my authority, be it man
or woman, or other between [these names<a name="FNanchor_109" id=

mischief. Heard'st thou, or heard'st thou not, or am I speaking to
a deaf woman?</p>

even then I was carried away by terror to offer my supplications to
the Immortals, that they would extend their protection over the
city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Pray that our fortification may
resist the hostile spear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Shall not this, then, be at the
disposal of the gods?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Ay, but 'tis said that the gods
of the captured city abandon it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> At no time during my life may
this conclave of gods abandon us: never may I behold our city
overrun, and an army firing it with hostile flame.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Do not thou, invoking the gods,
take ill counsel; for subordination, woman, is the mother of saving
success; so the adage runs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> But the gods have a power
superior still, and oft in adversity does this raise the helpless
out of severe calamity, when clouds are overhanging his brow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> It is the business of men, to
present victims and offer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63"
id="Page_63">63</a></span>ings of worship to the gods, when foemen
are making an attempt: 'tis thine on the other hand to hold thy
peace and abide within doors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> 'Tis by the blessing of the gods
that we inhabit a city unconquered, and that our fortification is
proof against the multitude of our enemies. What Nemesis can feel
offended at this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> I am not offended that ye should
honor the race of the gods; but that thou mayest not render the
citizens faint-hearted, keep quiet and yield not to excessive
terrors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> When I heard the sudden din, I
came, on the very instant, in distracting panic to this Acropolis,
a hallowed seat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Do not now, if ye hear of the
dying or the wounded, eagerly receive them with shrieks; for with
this slaughter of mortals is Mars fed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> And I do in truth hear the
snortings of the horses.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Do not now, when thou hearest
them, hear too distinctly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Our city groans from the ground,
as though the foes were hemming her in.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Is it not then enough that I take
measures for this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I fear! for the battering at the
gates increases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Wilt thou not be silent? Say
nought of this kind in the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> O associate band [of gods],
abandon not our towers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Can not ye endure it in silence,
and confusion to ye?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Gods of my city! let me not meet
with slavery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Thou thyself art making a slave
both of me, of thyself, and of the city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> O all-potent Jove! turn the shaft
against our foes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> O Jove! what a race hast thou
made women!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id=

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Just as wretched as men when
their city is taken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Again thou art yelping as thou
claspest the statues!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Yes, for in my panic terror
hurries away my tongue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Would to heaven that you would
grant me a trifling favor on my requesting it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Tell me as quickly as you can,
and I shall know at once.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Hold thy peace, wretched woman,
alarm not thy friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I hold my peace&mdash;with others
I will suffer what is destined.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> I prefer this expression of thine
rather than thy former words; and moreover, coming forth from the
statues, pray thou for the best&mdash;that the gods may be our
allies. And after thou hast listened to my prayers, then do thou
raise the sacred auspicious shout of the P&aelig;an, the Grecian
rite of sacrificial acclamation, an encouragement to thy friends
that removes the fear of the foe. And I, to the tutelary gods of
our land, both those who haunt the plains, and those who watch over
the forum, and to the fountains of Dirce, and I speak not without
those of the Ismenus,<a name="FNanchor_112" id=
"FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>
if things turn out well and our city is preserved, do thus make my
vows that we, dyeing the altars of the gods with the blood of
sheep, offering bulls to the gods, will deposit trophies, and
vestments of our enemies, spear-won spoils of the foe, in their
hallowed abodes. Offer thou prayers like these to the gods, not
with a number of sighs, nor with foolish and wild sobbings; for not
one whit the more wilt thou escape <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>Destiny. But I too, forsooth,<a
name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113"
class="fnanchor">113</a> will go and marshal at the seven outlets
of our walls, six men, with myself for a seventh, antagonists to
our foes in gallant plight, before both urgent messengers and
quickly-bruited tidings arrive, and inflame us by the crisis.</p>

<p class="four">[<i>Exit</i> <span class=
"smcap">Eteocles</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I attend, but through terror my
heart sleeps not, and cares that press close upon my heart keep my
dread alive, because of the host that hems our walls<a name=
"FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class=
"fnanchor">114</a> around; like as a dove, an all-attentive nurse,
fears, on behalf of her brood, serpents, evil intruders into her
nest. For some are advancing against the towers in all their
numbers, in all their array; (what will become of me?) and others
are launching the vast rugged stone at the citizens, who are
assailed on all sides. By every means, O ye Jove-descended gods!
rescue the city and the army that spring from Cadmus. What better
plain of land will ye take in exchange to yourselves than this,
after ye have abandoned to our enemies the fertile land, and
Dirce's water best fed of all the streams that earth-encircling
Neptune sends forth, and the daughters of Tethys? Wherefore, O
tutelary gods of the city! having hurled on those without the
towers the calamity that slaughters men, and casts away shields,
achieve glory for these citizens, and be your statues placed on
noble sites, as deliverers of our city,<a name="FNanchor_115" id=
"FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>
through our entreaties fraught with <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>shrill groanings. For sad it is
to send prematurely to destruction an ancient city, a prey of
slavery to the spear, ingloriously overthrown in crumbling ashes by
an Ach&aelig;an according to the will of heaven; and for its women
to be dragged away captives, alas! alas! both the young and the
aged, like horses by their hair, while their vestments are rent
about their persons. And the emptied city cries aloud, while its
booty is wasted amid confused clamors; verily I fearfully forbode
heavy calamities. And a mournful thing it is for [maidens] just
marriageable,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> before the celebration of
rites for culling the fresh flower of their virginity, to have to
traverse a hateful journey from their homes. What? I pronounce that
the dead fares better than these; for full many are the calamities,
alas! alas! which a city undergoes when it has been reduced. One
drags another,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> slaughters, and to parts
he sets fire&mdash;the whole city is defiled with smoke, and raving
Mars that tramples down the nations, violating piety, inspires
them. Throughout the town are uproars, against the city rises the
turreted circumvallation,<a name="FNanchor_118" id=
"FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>
and man is slain by man with the spear. And the cries of children
at the breast all bloody resound, and there is rapine sister of
pell-mell confusion. Pillager meets pillager, and the empty-handed
shouts to the empty-handed, wishing to have a partner, greedy for a
portion that shall be neither less nor equal. What of these things
can speech picture? Fruits of every possible kind strewn<a name=
"FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class=
"fnanchor">119</a> upon the ground occasion <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>sorrow, and
dismal is the face of the stewards. And full many a gift of earth
is swept along in the worthless streams, in undistinguished medley.
And young female slaves have new sorrows, a foe being superior<a
name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120"
class="fnanchor">120</a> and fortunate as to their wretched captive
couch, so that they hope for life's gloomy close to come, a
guardian against their all-mournful sorrows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Semi-Ch.</span> The scout, methinks, my

haste the forwarding axles<a name="FNanchor_121" id=

of his feet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Semi-Ch.</span> Ay, and in very truth, here

<p class="three">[<i>Re-enter</i> <span class=

<p><span class="smcap">Mes.</span> I would fain tell, for I know
them well, the arrangements of our adversaries, and how each has
obtained his lot at our gate. Tydeus now for some time has been
raging hard by the gates of Pr&oelig;tus; but the seer allows him
not to cross the stream of Ismenus, for the sacrifices are not
auspicious. So Tydeus, raving and greedy for the fight, roars like
a serpent in its hissings beneath the noontide heat, and he smites
the sage seer, son of O&iuml;cleus, with a taunt, [saying] that he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id=
"Page_68">68</a></span>is crouching to both Death and Battle out of
cowardice. Shouting out such words as these, he shakes there
shadowy crests, the hairy honors of his helm, while beneath his
buckler bells cast in brass are shrilly pealing terror: on his
buckler too he has this arrogant device&mdash;a gleaming sky
tricked out with stars, and in the centre of the shield a brilliant
full moon is conspicuous, most august of the heavenly bodies, the
eye of night. Chafing thus in his vaunting harness, he roars beside
the bank of the river, enamored of conflict, like a steed champing
his bit with rage, that rushes forth when he hears the voice of the
trumpet.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Whom wilt thou marshal
against this [foe]? Who, when the fastenings give way, is fit to be
intrusted with the defense of the gate of Pr&oelig;tus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> At no possible array of a man
should I tremble; and blazonry has no power of inflicting wounds,
and crests and bell bite not<a name="FNanchor_124" id=
"FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>
without the spear. And for this night which thou tellest me is
sparkling on his buckler with the stars of heaven, it may perchance
be a prophet in conceit;<a name="FNanchor_125" id=
"FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
for if night shall settle on his eyes as he is dying, verily this
vaunting device would correctly and justly answer to its name, and
he himself will have the insolence ominous <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>against himself. But
against Tydeus will I marshal this wary son of Astacus, as defender
of the portals, full nobly born, and one that reverences the throne
of Modesty, and detests too haughty language, for he is wont to be
slow at base acts, but no dastard. And from the sown heroes whom
Mars spared is Melanippus sprung a scion, and he is thoroughly a
native. But the event Mars with his dice will decide. And justice,
his near kinswoman, makes him her champion,<a name="FNanchor_126"
id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class=
"fnanchor">126</a> that he may ward off the foeman's spear from the
mother that bare him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> Now may the gods grant unto our
champion to be successful, since with justice<a name="FNanchor_127"
id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class=
"fnanchor">127</a> does he speed forth in defense of the city; but
I shudder to behold the sanguinary fate of those who perish in
behalf of their friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mes.</span> To him may the gods so grant
success. But Capaneus has by lot obtained his station against the
Electran gate. This is a giant, greater than the other
aforementioned, and his vaunt savors not of humanity; but he
threatens horrors against our towers, which may fortune not bring
to pass! for he declares, that whether the god is willing or
unwilling, he will make havoc of our city, and that not the Wrath<a
name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128"
class="fnanchor">128</a> of Jove, dashing down upon the plain,
should stop him. And he is wont to compare both the lightnings and
the thunder-bolts to the heat of noontide. He has a bearing <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>too, a
naked man bearing fire, and there gleams a torch with which his
hands are armed;<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a
href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> and, in letters of
gold, he is uttering, <span class="smcap">I will burn the
city.</span> Against a man such as this do thou send<a name=
"FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class=

will abide his vaunting and not tremble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> And in this case<a name=
"FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class=
"fnanchor">131</a> also one advantage is gained upon another. Of
the vain conceits of man in sooth the tongue of truth becomes
accuser. But Capaneus is menacing, prepared for action, dishonoring
the gods, and practicing his tongue in vain exultation; mortal as
he is, he is sending loud-swelling words into heaven to the ears of
Jove. But I trust that, as he well deserves, the fire-bearing
thunder-bolt will with justice come upon him, in no wise likened to
the noontide warmth of the sun. Yet against him, albeit he is a
very violent blusterer, is a hero marshaled, fiery in his spirit,
stout Polyphontes, a trusty guard by the favor of Diana our
protectress, and of the other gods. Mention another who hath had
his station fixed at another of our gates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> May he perish<a name=
"FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class=
"fnanchor">132</a> who proudly vaunts against our city, and may the
thunder-bolt check him before that he bursts into my abode, or
ever, with his insolent spear force us away from our maiden
dwellings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mes.</span> And verily I will mention him
that hath next had <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id=
"Page_71">71</a></span>his post allotted against our gates: for to
Eteoclus, third in order, hath the third lot leapt from the
inverted helm of glittering brass, for him to advance his battalion
against the gates of Ne&iuml;s; and he is wheeling his steeds
fuming in their trappings, eager to dash forward against the gates.
And their snaffles ring, in barbarian fashion, filled with the
breath of their snorting nostrils. His buckler, too, hath been
blazoned in no paltry style, but a man in armor is treading the
steps of a ladder to his foemen's tower, seeking to storm it. And
this man, in a combination of letters, is shouting, how that not
even Mars should force him from the bulwarks. Do thou send also to
this man a worthy champion to ward off from this city the servile
yoke.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> I will send this man forthwith,
and may it be with good fortune; and verily he is sent, bearing his
boast in deed,<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Megareus, the offspring of
Creon, of the race of the sown;<a name="FNanchor_134" id=
"FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>
who will go forth from the gates not a whit terrified at the noise
of the mad snortings of the horses; but, either by his fall will
fully pay the debt of his nurture to the land, or, having taken two
men<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and the city on the
shield, will garnish with the spoils the house of his father. Vaunt
thee of another, and spare me not the recital.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I pray that this side may
succeed, O champion of my dwellings! and that with them it may go
ill; and as they, with frenzied mind, utter exceedingly proud
vaunts against our city, so may Jove the avenger regard them in his
wrath.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mes.</span> Another, the fourth, who
occupies the adjoining gates of Onca Minerva, stands hard by with a
shout, the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
"Page_72">72</a></span>shape and mighty mould of Hippomedon; and I
shuddered at him as he whirled the immense orb, I mean the
circumference of his buckler&mdash;I will not deny it. And
assuredly it was not any mean artificer in heraldry who produced
this work upon his buckler, a Typhon, darting forth through his
fire-breathing mouth dark smoke, the quivering sister of fire, and
the circular cavity of the hollow-bellied shield hath been made
farther solid with coils of serpents. He himself, too, hath raised
the war-cry; and, possessed by Mars, raves for the onslaught, like
a Thyiad,<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> glaring terror. Well must
we guard against the attack of such a man as this, for Terror is
already vaunting himself hard by our gates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> In the first place, this Onca
Pallas, who dwells in our suburbs, living near the gates, detesting
the insolence of the man, will drive him off, as a noxious serpent
from her young. And Hyperbius, worthy son of &OElig;nops, hath been
chosen to oppose him, man to man, willing to essay his destiny in
the crisis of fortune; he is open to censure neither in form, nor
in spirit, nor in array of arm: but Mercury hath matched them
fairly; for hostile is the man to the man with whom he will have to
combat, and on their bucklers will they bring into conflict hostile
gods; for the one hath fire-breathing Typhon, and on the buckler of
Hyperbius father Jove is seated firm, flashing, with his bolt in
his hand; and never yet did any one know of Jove being by any
chance vanquished.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a
href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> Such in good sooth is
the friend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73">73</a></span>ship of the divinities: we are on the side
of the victors, but they on that of the conquered, if at least Jove
be mightier in battle than Typhon. Wherefore 'tis probable that the
combatants will fare accordingly; and to Hyperbius, in accordance
with its blazonry, may Jove that is on his shield become a
savior.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> I feel confident that he who hath
upon his shield the adversary of Jove, the hateful form of the
subterranean fiend, a semblance hateful both to mortals and the
everliving gods, will have to leave his head before our gates.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mes.</span> May such be the issue! But,
farthermore, I mention the fifth, marshaled at the fifth gate, that
of Boreas, by the very tomb of Jove-born Amphion. And he makes oath
by the spear<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> which he grasps, daring to
revere it more than a god, and more dearly than his eyes,<a name=
"FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class=
"fnanchor">139</a> that verily he will make havoc of the city of
the Cadm&aelig;ans in spite of Jove: thus says the fair-faced scion
of a mountain-dwelling mother, a stripling hero, and the down is
just making its way through his cheeks, in the spring of his prime,
thick sprouting hair. And he takes his post, having a ruthless
spirit, not answering to his maidenly name,<a name="FNanchor_140"
id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class=
"fnanchor">140</a> and a savage aspect. Yet not <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>without his
vaunt does he take stand against our gates, for on his
brazen-forged shield the rounded bulwark of his body, he was
wielding the reproach of our city, the Sphinx of ruthless maw
affixed by means of studs, a gleaming embossed form; and under her
she holds a man, one of the Cadm&aelig;ans, so that against this
man<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> most shafts are hurled.
And he, a youth, Parthenop&aelig;us an Arcadian, seems to have come
to fight in no short measure,<a name="FNanchor_142" id=
"FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>
and not to disgrace the length of way that he has traversed; for
this man, such as he is, is a sojourner, and, by way of fully
repaying Argos for the goodly nurture she has given him, he utters
against these towers menaces, which may the deity not fulfill.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> O may they receive from the gods
the things which they are purposing in those very unhallowed
vaunts! Assuredly they would perish most miserably in utter
destruction. But there is [provided] for this man also, the
Arcadian of whom you speak, a man that is no braggart, but his hand
discerns what should be done, Actor, brother of the one
aforementioned, who will not allow either a tongue, without deeds,
streaming within our gates, to aggravate mischiefs, nor him to make
his way within who bears upon his hostile buckler the image of the
wild beast, most odious monster, which from the outside shall find
fault with him who bears it within, when it meets with a thick
battering under the city. So, please the gods, may I be speaking
the truth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ch.</span> The tale pierces my bosom, the
locks of my hair stand erect, when I hear of the big words of these
proudly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id=
"Page_75">75</a></span>vaunting impious men. Oh! would that the
gods would destroy them in the land.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mes.</span> I will tell of the sixth, a man
most prudent, and in valor the best, the seer, the mighty
Amphiaraus; for he, having been marshaled against the gate of
Homol&ouml;is, reviles mighty Tydeus full oft with reproaches, as the
homicide, the troubler of the state, chief teacher of the mischiefs
of Argos, the summoner of Erinnys, minister of slaughter, and
adviser of these mischiefs to Adrastus. Then again going up<a name=
"FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class=
"fnanchor">143</a> to thy brother, the mighty Polynices, he casts
his eye aloft, and, at last, reproachfully dividing his name [into
syllables,<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>] he calls to him: and
through his mouth he gives utterance to this speech&mdash;"Verily
such a deed is well-pleasing to the gods, and glorious to hear of
and to tell in after times, that you are making havoc of your
paternal city, and its native gods, having brought into it a
foreign armament. And what Justice shall staunch the fountain of
thy mother's tears?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id=
"Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>And how can thy father-land, after having been taken by the
spear through thy means, ever be an ally to thee? I, for my part,
in very truth shall fatten this soil, seer as I am, buried beneath
a hostile earth. Let us to the battle, I look not for a
dishonorable fall." Thus spake the seer, wielding a fair-orbed
shield, all of brass; but no device was on its circle&mdash;for he
wishes not to seem but to be righteous, reaping fruit from a deep
furrow in his mind, from which sprout forth his goodly counsels.
Against this champion I advise that thou send antagonists, both
wise and good. A dread adversary is he that reveres the gods.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Et.</span> Alas! for the omen<a name=
"FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class=
"fnanchor">145</a> that associates a righteous man with the
impious! Indeed in every matter, nothing is worse than evil
fellowship&mdash;the field of infatuation has death for its
fruits.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> For whether it be that a
pious man hath embarked in a vessel along with violent sailors, and
some villany, he perishes with the race of men abhorred of heaven;
or, being righteous, and having rightly fallen into the same toils
with his countrymen, violators of hospitality, and unmindful of the
gods, he is beaten down, smitten with the scourge of the deity,
which falls alike on all. Now this seer, I mean the son of
O&iuml;cleus, a moderate, just, good, and pious man, a mighty

has, moreover, a newly-constructed shield, well suited [to his arm]

mailed warrior, forged out of brass, conducting him decorously; and
so she professes to be Justice, as the inscription tells: <span

city of his fathers, and a dwelling in the palace</span>. Such are
their devices; and do thou thyself now determine whom it is that

wail, lest birth be given to a lament yet more intolerable. But to
Polynices, that well deserves his name, I say, soon shall we know
what issue his blazonry will have; whether letters wrought in gold,
vainly vaunting on his buckler, along with frenzy of soul will
restore him. If indeed Justice, the virgin daughter of Jove,
attended on his actions or his thoughts, perchance this might be.
But neither when he escape the darkness of the womb, nor in his
infancy, nor ever in his boyhood, nor in the gathering of the hair
on his chin, did Justice look on him, or deem him worthy her
regards: nor truly do I suppose that she will now take her stand
near to him, in his ill-omened possession of his father-land. Truly
she would then in all reason be falsely called Justice, were she to
consort with a man all-daring in his soul. Trusting in this I will
go, and face him in person. Who else could do so with better right?

apprised of his wretched marriage, despairing in his sorrow, with

himself with parricidal hand of the eyes that were more precious
than his children. And indignant because of his scanty supply of
food,<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> he sent upon his sons,
alas! alas! a curse horrible in utterance, even that they should

should be on the point of fulfilling that prayer.</p>

<p>'Tis my duty to announce the good pleasure and the decree of the
senators of the people of this city of Cadmus. It is resolved to
bury this body of Eteocles for his attachment to his country, with
the dear interment in earth! for in repelling our foes he met death
in the city, and being pure in respect to the sacred rites of his
country, blameless hath he fallen where 'tis glorious for the young
to fall; thus, indeed, hath it been commissioned me to announce
concerning this corpse: But [it has been decreed] to cast out
unburied, a prey for dogs, this the corpse of his brother
Polynices, inasmuch as he would have been the overturner of the
land of Cadmus, if some one of the gods had not stood in opposition
to his spear: and even now that he is dead, he will lie under the
guilt of pollution with the gods of his country, whom he having
dishonored was for taking the city by bringing against it a foreign
host. So it is resolved that he, having been buried dishonorably by
winged fowls, should receive his recompense, and that neither
piling up by hands of the mound over his tomb should follow, nor
any one honor him with shrill-voiced wailings, but that he be
ungraced with a funeral at the hands of his friends. Such is the
decree of the magistracy of the Cadm&aelig;ans.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id=

<p><span class="smcap">Ant.</span> But I say to the rulers of the

part with me in burying him, I will bury him, and will expose
myself<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> to peril by burying my
brother. And I feel no shame at being guilty of this disobedient
insubordination against the city. Powerful is the tie of the common
womb from which we sprung, from a wretched mother and a hapless
sire. Wherefore, my soul, do thou, willing with the willing share
in his woes, with the dead, thou living, with sisterly
feeling&mdash;and nought shall lean-bellied wolves tear his
flesh&mdash;let no one suppose it. All woman though I be, I will
contrive a tomb and a deep-dug grave for him, bearing earth in the
bosom-fold of my fine linen robe, and I myself will cover him; let
none imagine the contrary: an effective scheme shall aid my
boldness.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Her.</span> I bid thee not to act despite

heart neither to bewail thee nor to escort thee to the tomb? But I
dread and shrink from the terror of the citizens. Thou, at all
events, shalt in sooth have many mourners; but he, wretched one,
departs unsighed for, having the solitary-wailing dirge of his
sister. Who will agree to this?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sem.</span> Let the state do or not do aught
to those who bewail Polynices. We, on this side will go and join to
escort his funeral procession; for both this sorrow is common to
the race, and the state at different times sanctions different
maxims of justice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sem.</span> But we will go with this corpse,
as both the city and justice join to sanction. For next to the
Immortals and the might of Jove, this man prevented the city of the
Cadm&aelig;ans from being destroyed, and thoroughly overwhelmed by
the surge of foreign enemies.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">1</span></a> Lucian, in his
dialogue entitled "Prometheus," or "Caucasus," has given occasional
imitations of passages in this play, not, however, sufficient to
amount to a paraphrase, as Dr. Blomfield asserted. Besides, as
Lucian lays the scene at Caucasus, he would rather seem to have had
the "Prometheus solutus" in mind. (See Schutz, Argum.) But the
ancients commonly made Caucasus the seat of the punishment of
Prometheus, and, as &AElig;schylus is not over particular in his
geography, it is possible that he may be not altogether consistent
with himself. Lucian makes no mention of Strength and Force, but
brings in Mercury at the beginning of the dialogue. Moreover,
Mercury is represented in an excellent humor, and rallies
Prometheus good-naturedly upon his tortures. Thus, &sect;6, he
says, &epsilon;&#8022; &#7956;&chi;&epsilon;&iota;.
&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&pi;&tau;&#8053;&sigma;&epsilon;&tau;&alpha;&iota;
&delta;&#8050; &#7972;&delta;&eta; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054; &#8001;

&epsilon;&#8016;&mu;&eta;&chi;&#8049;&nu;&omicron;&upsilon;
&pi;&lambda;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&iota;&kappa;&#8134;&sigmaf;. In
regard to the place where Prometheus was bound, the scene doubtless
represented a ravine between two precipices rent from each other,
with a distant prospect of some of the places mentioned in the
wanderings of Io. (See Schutz, <i>ibid.</i>) But as the whole
mention of Scythia is an anachronism, the less said on this point
the better. Compare, however, the following remarks of Humboldt,
Cosmos, vol. ii. p. 140, "The legend of Prometheus, and the
unbinding of the chains of the fire-bringing Titan on the Caucasus
by Hercules in journeying eastward&mdash;the ascent of Io from the
valley of the Hybrites&mdash;[See Griffiths' note on v. 717, on
&#8017;&beta;&rho;&iota;&sigma;&tau;&#8052;&sigmaf;
&pi;&omicron;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&#8056;&sigmaf;, which <i>must</i> be
a proper name]&mdash;toward the Caucasus; and the myth of Phryxus
and Helle&mdash;all point to the same path on which Ph&oelig;nician
navigators had earlier adventured."</p>

of this passage have been increased by no one of the commentators
perceiving the evident opposition between
&Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8054; and
&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8059;&sigmaf;. As in the formula &#8038;
&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8166; &kappa;&alpha;&#8054;
&Theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8054; (cf. Plato Protag. p. 193, E.;
Aristoph. Plut. I. with Bergler's note; Julian C&aelig;s. p. 51,
59, 76; Dionys. Hal. A. R. II. p. 80, 32-81, 20, ed. Sylb.) so,
from the time of Homer downward, we find
&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8058;&sigmaf; constantly mentioned apart from the
other gods (cf. Il. I. 423, 494), and so also with his epithet
&pi;&alpha;&tau;&#8052;&rho;, as in v. 4, 17, 20, etc. (Eustath,
on Il. T. I., p. 111, 30, &#8005;&tau;&iota;
&Zeta;&epsilon;&#8058;&sigmaf;
&#7936;&lambda;&lambda;&alpha;&chi;&omicron;&#8166; &mu;&#8050;&nu;
&#7937;&pi;&lambda;&#8182;&sigmaf; &pi;&alpha;&tau;&#8052;&rho;
&#7952;&lambda;&#8051;&chi;&theta;&eta;). There is evidently,
therefore, the opposition expressed in the text: "'Tis not for the
other gods (<i>i.e.</i> &tau;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;
&#7940;&lambda;&lambda;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
&theta;&epsilon;&omicron;&#8150;&sigmaf;) to rule, but for Jove
alone." This view was approved, but not confirmed, by Paley.</p>

makes Hesiod acquainted with these eruptions. (See Goettling on
Theog. 821.) But Prometheus here utters a prophecy concerning an
eruption that really took place during the life of &AElig;schylus,
Ol. 75, 2, B.C. 479. Cf. Thucydides III. 116; Cluver, Sicil. Antig.
p. 104, and Dindorf's clear and learned note. There can be little
doubt but Enceladus and Typhon are only different names for the
same monster. Burges has well remarked the resemblance between the
Egyptian Typho and the Grecian, and considers them both as "two
outward forms of one internal idea, representing the destructive
principle of matter opposed to the creative." I shall refer the
reader to Plutarch's entertaining treatise on Isis and Osiris; but
to quote authorities from Herodotus down to the Apologetic Fathers,

<p>This writer, who constantly has the Athenian dramatists in view,
pursues the narrative of Io's wanderings with an evident reference
to &AElig;schylus. See other illustrations from the poets in
Stanley's notes.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_48" id="Footnote_48"></a><a href=
"#FNanchor_48"><span class="label">48</span></a> The ghost of Argus
was doubtless whimsically represented, but probably without the
waste of flour that is peculiar to modern stage spectres. Perhaps,
as Burges describes, "a mute in a dress resembling a peacock's tail
expanded, and with a Pan's pipe slung to his side, which ever and
anon he seems to sound; and with a goad in his hand, mounted at one
end with a representation of a hornet or gad-fly." But this
phantom, like Macbeth's dagger, is supposed to be in the mind only.
With a similar idea Apuleius, Apol. p. 315, ed. Elm. invokes upon
&AElig;milianus in the following mild terms: "At ... semper obvias
species mortuorum, quidquid umbrarum est usquam, quidquid lemurum,
quidquid manium, quidquid larvarum oculis tuis oggerat: omnia
noctium occursacula, omnia bustorum formidamina, omnia sepulchrorum
terriculamenta, a quibus tamen &aelig;vo emerito haud longe
abes."</p>

difficulty in this passage. Dindorf understands
&#7952;&kappa;&epsilon;&#8055;&nu;&omega;&nu;
(&Atilde;&dagger;gypti filiorum), and so Paley, referring to his
notes on Ag. 938, Suppl. 437. Mr. Jelf, Gk. Gr., &sect; 696, Obs.

any need of alteration. On the other interpretation sometimes given

&sigma;&phi;&alpha;&gamma;&alpha;&#8150;&sigma;&iota; is rightly
rendered "in jugulo" by Blomfield, after Ruhnk. Ep. Crit. I. p. 71.
To the examples quoted add Apul. Met. I. p. 108, "per jugulum
sinistrum capulotenus gladium totum ei demergit," and p. 110,
"jugulo ejus vulnus dehiscit in patorem," The expression

&pi;&rho;&omicron;&sigma;&mu;&omicron;&lambda;&#8060;&nu;
&#8001;&mu;&#8057;&sigma;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&nu; seems
simpler, and in better taste.
&#8001;&mu;&#8057;&sigma;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&nu; was
doubtless obliterated by the gloss
&#7936;&delta;&epsilon;&lambda;&phi;&epsilon;&#8057;&nu; (an Ionic
form ill suited to the senarius), and the
&#8001;&mu;&omicron;&iota;&omicron;&tau;&#8051;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&tau;&omicron;&nu;
caused the remainder of the error. Burges first proposed
&#8001;&mu;&#8057;&sigma;&pi;&omicron;&rho;&omicron;&nu; in Troad.
Append. p. 134, D. As to Paley's idea that &OElig;dipus' death was
caused "<i>per contentiorim filii indolem</i>," I can not find
either authority for the fact, or reason for its mention here, and
I have therefore followed Blomfield. Dindorf's translation I can
not understand. The explanations of
&#7952;&xi;&upsilon;&pi;&tau;&iota;&#8049;&zeta;&omega;&nu;
&#8004;&nu;&omicron;&mu;&alpha; are amusing, and that is all.</p>

<p>Horace's rule, "Nec quarta loqui persona laboret," seems to have
been drawn from the practice of the Greek stage. Only three actors
were allowed to each of the competitor-dramatists, and these were
assigned to them by lot. (Hesychius,
&Nu;&#8051;&mu;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;
&#8017;&pi;&omicron;&kappa;&rho;&iota;&tau;&#8182;&nu;.) Thus, for
instance, as is remarked by a writer in the Quarterly Review, in
the &OElig;dipus at Colonus, v. 509, Ismene goes to offer
sacrifice, and, after about forty lines, returns in the character
of Theseus. Soon afterward, v. 847, Antigone is carried off by
Creon's attendants, and returns as Theseus after about the same
interval as before.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Old
